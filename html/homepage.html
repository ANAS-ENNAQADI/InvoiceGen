            <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
            <p>Sending e-invoices through the network is an easy process:</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>1.Create a free Invoiced account.</li>
                <li>2.Invite your buyer to join your Invoiced network.</li>
                <li>3.Once connected to your buyer on the network, you can send invoices from Invoiced.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How Do I Get Paid?</h3>
            <p>After signing up, you can enable the payment methods you want to accept in your Invoiced account. Buyers can pay with direct debit, virtual card, and credit card.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How Do I Access My Invoices?</h3>
            <p>Invoices are securely stored in the cloud in case you ever need to retrieve them for tax or legal reasons.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How Much Does It Cost?</h3>
            <p>Invoiced is 100% free to send and receive invoices. If you choose to accept payments through the network, there is a payment processing fee when your buyer makes a successful payment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why Is It Better Than Email?</h3>
            <p>With e-invoicing, your invoices no longer get lost in someone's email inbox. In addition to sending a PDF of the invoice, your buyer will receive line item level invoice data that can be plugged into their accounts payable portal or accounting system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How Secure Is the Network?</h3>
            <p>Sending invoices through Invoiced is a more secure option than sending invoices through email. E-invoicing is also beneficial to your buyers, as they will be assured when they receive invoices from you through the network that they are authentic.</p>
